# web-app_street-art

Create a web-based app with a database connection to an android app
Created this project in a group with 4 people including myself

## Project overview:

* Crowd sourced application
* Login functionality
* Ability to post information including images, location, and text
* Designating a theme for each post
* Ability to add a personal "tag" to each post similar to a hastag
* Ability to search based on user, theme, and "tag"



## Project details:
* Created an app that is designed to take pictures of street art post it to app
* Similar to other image posting applications but with a focus on different types of street art
* Used location as a functionality for other users to be able to find the street art
* Themes were based on the different styles of street art
* Created an integrated database that allows the user to hav access to the posts in both the android and web-app
* Created and used an API to help with the flow of information between the web-app and the android app
* Created a login page that allows the user to create an account and create or alter their own posts


_Future updates can involve allowing a tag to become a theme if it is posted enough based on the users and supervision of the themes._
